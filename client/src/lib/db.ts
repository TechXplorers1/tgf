// Initial Data (Sourced from your previous hardcoded values)

// Imports for images (We can't import images directly in this non-component file easily if we want to run it in node, 
// but for client-side bundle it's fine. However, to keep it simple, we will use string paths or require assumes standard build).
// Actually, let's keep the initial data empty or rely on the components to seed it if empty? 
// Better: Define the initial data here with hardcoded paths/imports if possible, or string placeholders that components resolve.
// Since Vite handles imports, we can import here.
